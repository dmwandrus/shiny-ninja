This is my research into how camel uses event notifier, an osgi eventing 
concept.

It isn't the cleanest...oh well.  There are two different notifier bundles - a
& b, each of which call a bean every 15 seconds with a camel timer. 

Each camel context that you want to monitor, you add in a event notifier bean,
and it listens on that local context for camel events and then sends a custom
message to a custom event admin topic. 

Then there is ONE processor for that custom event admin topic, and it gets 
messages from all the camel contexts that are sending to that topic. 
By the way, don't put a notifier in the same camel context in which you 
configure this processor, because, uh, well, you'll get a stack overflow.
