This is a simple example of how camel aggregator works. 

1) I have a message sender which sends out messages with a randomly chosen
   correlation id, every x milliseconds. (camel timer & a processor)
2) I have an aggregator, which matches on those correlation ids. It stores  
   unmatched messages in a hawtdb data store

What I've learned: 

The aggregator method is called for every message, 
regardless of whether or not there has been a match, SO, one of the events/
messages WILL be null, regularly. 

The unmatched messages are not held in memory, they're just stuck into 
hawtdb until they are matched.

If there are a lot of unmatched messages and the hawtdb file store grows to
hundreds of megabytes, then, that's the size the file is going to be from 
then on. It doesn't automatically shrink itself.
